Q3. Describe REPL
	
REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it
	represents a computer environment like a Windows console or
	Unix/Linux shell where a command is entered and the system responds
	with an output in an interactive mode. Node.js or Node comes
	bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the following tasks âˆ’
	Read âˆ’ Reads user's input, parses the
	input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.
	Eval âˆ’ Takes and evaluates the data
	structure.
	Print âˆ’ Prints the result.
	Loop âˆ’ Loops the above command until the
	user presses ctrl-c twice.
	The REPL feature of Node is very useful in
	experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes.


Q4. Iterators in ruby.
	
	a) Ruby each Iterator:
	The each iterator returns all the elements of an
	array or a hash.

	b) Ruby collect Iterator:
	The collect iterator returns all the
	elements of a collection.

Q5. Write a ruby program for operator
overloading :

	class Tester1
	 def initialize x
	   @x = x
	 end
	 def +(y)
	   @x.to_s + y.to_s
	 end
	end
	a = Tester1.new 11.to_s
	puts(a+22)
