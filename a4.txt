Assignment 4



Q1. What is a bundler?
	Bundler provides a consistent environment for
	Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions
	that are needed.
	Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and
	ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging,
	and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as bundle
	install.
	$ gem install bundler â€“ installs bundler


Q2. What does the bundle install command do?
	Installs the dependencies specified in the
	Gemfile.Install the gems specified in your Gemfile(5). If this
	is the first time you run bundle install (and a Gemfile.lock does
	not exist), bundler will fetch all remote sources, resolve
	dependencies and install all needed gems.
	If a gemfile.lock does exist, and you
	have not updated your Gemfile(5), bundler will fetch all remote
	sources, but use the dependencies specified in
	the Gemfile.lock instead of resolving dependencies.
	If a Gemfile.lock does exist, and you
	have updated your Gemfile(5), bundler will use the dependencies
	in theGemfile.lock for all gems that you did not update, but
	will re-resolve the dependencies of gems that you did update. 


Q3. What is a gemfile?
	A Gemfile is a file we create which is
	used for describing gem dependencies for Ruby programs. A gem is a
	collection of Ruby code that we can extract into a â€œcollectionâ€
	which we can call later.A  Gemfile is a file we create which is

	Your Gemfile should always be in the root of
	your project directory, this is where Bundler expects it to be and it
	is the standard place for any package manager style files to live.
	It is useful to note that your Gemfile is
	evaluated as Ruby code. When it is evaluated by Bundler the
	context it is in allows us access to certain methods that we will use
	to explain our gem requirements.Ruby developers use Gemfiles all the
	time, and most of us know how to do the basics. In this post I want
	to dive deep into everything we can do with a Gemfile.
