Assignment 5


Q1. What are routes? 
	Sinatra routes are simply Ruby methods with an
	associated code block that get called every time a request matches
	the given route pattern.The :id part of the route pattern
	is a named parameter and will be accessible in your code
	from the params hash: params[:id], but I'll describe these in
	further detail later in this post.Routes are matched in the exact
	order that they are defined in your code, this means that second
	route in the below example will never get matched because we have the
	exact same pattern further up in the code.The explicit routes should
	always be added towards the top of your route file or controller. I
	can guarantee you that this has been the source a many hours of
	frustration by developers working with Sinatra.Route method names
	correspond to HTTP 1.1 request method names to make things
	easier to remember.


Q2. How to add a new gem to your project?
	Add whatever gem you want to use in Gemfile.
	Execute bundle install


Q3. Sinatra application to calcule nth fibonaci
number.

	require 'sinatra'

	get '/' do
		name = params[:name]
		if name!=nil
			return "Hello #{name}!"
		else 
			return "No parameter!"
		end
	end

	get '/Fibo' do
		n = params[:n]
		if n!=nil
			i = n.to_i
			num = Fib(i)
			return "Value = #{num}"
		else
			return "No parameters given!"
		end
		
	end
	def Fib(n)
		i=2
		a=0
		b=1
		while i<n
			c = a + b
			a = b
			b = c
			i = i + 1
		end
		return c 
	end
